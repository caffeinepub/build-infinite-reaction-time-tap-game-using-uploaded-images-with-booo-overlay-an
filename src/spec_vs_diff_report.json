  "summary": "REQ-30 is only partially met: the reaction-time number is larger, and the sentence text appears to match the required wording, but the number does not use a more prominent/higher-contrast color than the surrounding sentence. REQ-29 is partially evidenced: the download fallback appears removed and a screenshot/share hint is shown on share failure, but the diff does not show a clearly visible screenshot instruction being present on the Share Preview screen by default (it appears only after a failed/unsupported share).",

      "id": "REQ-29",
      "requirement": "On the Share Preview screen, there is a clearly visible instruction in English telling users to take a screenshot and share it on social media.",
      "reason": "In the diff, the screenshot instruction UI is only rendered when `showScreenshotHint` is true, which is set only after share failure/unsupported; there is no evidence the instruction is clearly visible on the Share Preview screen without first attempting Share.",

      "id": "REQ-30",
      "requirement": "The reaction time number uses a more prominent, higher-contrast color than the surrounding sentence text.",
      "reason": "The surrounding sentence uses `pixelStyles.statusReady` which maps to `text-accent`, and the emphasized number style also uses `text-accent`, so the number is not a higher-contrast/more prominent color than the surrounding text (only larger/bolder).",
